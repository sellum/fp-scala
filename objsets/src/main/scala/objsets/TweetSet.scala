/**
  * This represents a set of objects of type `Tweet` in the form of a binary search
  * tree. Every branch in the tree has two children (two `TweetSet`s). There is an
  * invariant which always holds: for every branch `b`, all elements in the left
  * subtree are smaller than the tweet at `b`. The elements in the right subtree are
  * larger.
  *
  * Note that the above structure requires us to be able to compare two tweets (we
  * need to be able to say which of two tweets is larger, or if they are equal). In
  * this implementation, the equality / order of tweets is based on the tweet's text
  * (see `def incl`). Hence, a `TweetSet` could not contain two tweets with the same
  * text from different users.
  *
  *
  * The advantage of representing sets as binary search trees is that the elements
  * of the set can be found quickly. If you want to learn more you can take a look
  * at the Wikipedia page [1], but this is not necessary in order to solve this
  * assignment.
